# Now

## Status

**Codex modernization is live on `origin/main`, and the vault docs have been synced after the push.** The repo is Codex-first, tracked Claude-specific artifacts were removed, stale Wowhead runtime code was deleted, admin auth is safer in production, compose admin remains usable with local-only overrides, and the Maxximusboom missing-gear queue fix from main was preserved.

**Favicon update is live on production.** `app/icon.svg` now uses the same SVG mark as the navigation logo, and `public/favicon.ico` fixes the legacy `/favicon.ico` 404 reported from production. After deploy, production returned HTTP 200 for both `/favicon.ico` and `/icon.svg`.
